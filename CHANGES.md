## SoundCloud OAuth Integration

SoundCloud has deprecated client_id-based authentication in favor of OAuth tokens. This update implements the OAuth2 client credentials flow for SoundCloud API access.

### Changes:

1. Created a new API route `client/app/api/soundcloud/token/route.ts` that:
   - Implements POST to https://api.soundcloud.com/oauth2/token
   - Caches access_token in memory
   - Responds with { access_token } on GET

2. Updated client-side SoundCloud API implementation:
   - Modified `client/src/lib/api/soundcloud.ts` to use OAuth tokens
   - Added token caching for better performance
   - Improved error handling and logging

3. Created a server-side implementation in `fix/providers/soundcloud.ts`:
   - Implements the same OAuth flow for server-side requests
   - Includes token caching
   - Provides detailed search across both artists and tracks

4. API Endpoint Changes:
   - Updated all SoundCloud API URLs from api-v2.soundcloud.com to api.soundcloud.com
   - Replaced client_id query parameters with Authorization headers
   - Added proper error handling for OAuth authentication failures

These changes ensure compatibility with SoundCloud's current API requirements and improve the reliability of SoundCloud search results in the artist dropdown.
